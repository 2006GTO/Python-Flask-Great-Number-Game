# Python-Flask-Great-Number-Game
Guess the random number

Install flask using pip in your terminal (pip install Flask)

Install/Run a virtual environment https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/

In the root folder of this project, in your terminal, run "python server.py"

Navigate to localhost:5000

Try and guess the randomly-generated number!  You'll be told either too high, too low, or just right!  There is a validation checking to see if the string input is a whole integer or not.
